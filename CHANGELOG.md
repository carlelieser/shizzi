# Changelog

All notable changes to Shizzi are documented here.

This project follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/)
and [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-19

Tethered devices now get working IPv6, and a session tells you what it is
actually doing — how many devices are connected, how much has gone through,
and whether traffic is leaving over your VPN.

### Added

- **IPv6 for tethered clients.** Connected devices get a real IPv6 address and
  reach the v6 internet. Previously they were handed a v6 route that led
  nowhere, so sites that prefer IPv6 stalled before falling back to IPv4.
- **VPN status on the session.** The app shows whether tethered traffic is
  going out through your VPN, both in the app and on the notification, so you
  no longer have to take it on trust.
- **Device count and data used.** The session notification reports how many
  devices are on the hotspot and how much data the tunnel has carried,
  updated as you watch.

### Changed

- **A dropped VPN now stops the session.** If you started tethering through a
  VPN and it goes away, the hotspot stops instead of quietly continuing over
  your normal connection. Sessions started without a VPN are unaffected.
- **Clearer notification wording.** The notification no longer describes
  tethering as "protected" — it said the same thing whether or not a VPN was
  up. It now states plainly whether devices are going out through one.
- **Minimum Android version is now 13 (API 33), enforced at install.** Older
  devices could install 0.1.0 but never tether with it; the feature it depends
  on does not exist below Android 13. They are now told at install time
  instead of after setup.

### Fixed

- **IPv6 traffic no longer bypasses your VPN.** With a VPN up, IPv6 traffic
  from tethered devices previously escaped the tunnel. This was the known
  limitation noted in 0.1.0 and is now resolved.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-06

First public build.

### Added

- Wi-Fi tethering over a Shizuku-privileged test network: creates a test TUN
  interface, sets it as the preferred tethering upstream, and forwards hotspot
  traffic through a Go datapath.
- Requires Android 13 (API 33+) on arm64 and Shizuku 13.6.0+.

### Known limitations

- IPv6 was not suppressed on the downstream; v6 traffic could bypass the
  tunnel. Fixed in 0.2.0.
